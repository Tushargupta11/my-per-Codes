Introduction to java

control statements

object and class

constructor

static and non static

polymorphism
    method overloading
    method over riding

inheritence



constructor


   constructor is used to initialise the instence
   variable


   constructor name shoud be same as the class name
   constructor will not return any value
   constructor will be called automaticaly when
   the object is creted

   two type
   defacult constructor
   parametarised constructor



    this is the keyword - is used to refer the current object(instence variable, method)



polymorphism

method overloading -static biding

- method name are same
  parameter are different


   
method overriding -dynamic binding
 - signature is same
 - parameter is also same
   - during inheritence


   

inheritence



acquring the properties and the method from the existing class to the new class is called inheritance




    class A

        int x
 
        disp()

         {
          }

   class b extends A

        int y
        print()
{
}

    main
       b b1 new b

       b1.x
       b1.y
       b1.disp()
       b1.print()


       
we dont have multiple inheritance

simple


multilevel
